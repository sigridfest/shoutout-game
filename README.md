# ShoutOut
Shout-Out is a multiplayer quiz game that challenges players to answer questions about each other. The game begins with one player creating a lobby and sharing a code with other players to join. In each round, a question will be presented to all players about a certain characteristic or trait, and each player will have to choose the name of the player who they think best fits the description. For example, a question could be ”Which player is the most adventurous?” or ”Which player is the best at sports?”. Points will be awarded based on the number of players who chose the same answer. At the end of the game the players will be able to see who won overall.
